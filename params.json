One of the main features is the logical model, which serves as \r\nabstraction over physical data to provide end-user layer.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* OLAP and aggregated browsing (default backend is for relational databse - \r\n  ROLAP)\r\n* multidimensional analysis\r\n* logical view of analysed data - how analysts look at data, how they think of\r\n  data, not not how the data are physically implemented in the data stores\r\n* hierarchical dimensions (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies,\r\n  such as category-subcategory or country-region)\r\n* localizable metadata and data\r\n* OLAP server (WSGI HTTP server with JSON API based on Wergzeug)\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found at: http://packages.python.org/cubes\r\n\r\nSee `examples` directory for simple examples and use-cases. Also see:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/stiivi/cubes-examples\r\n    \r\nfor more complex examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource\r\n------\r\n\r\nGithub source repository: https://github.com/Stiivi/cubes\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDeveloped using python 2.7.\r\n\r\nMost of the requirements are soft (optional) and need to be satisfied only if \r\ncertain parts of cubes are being used.\r\n\r\n* SQLAlchemy from http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ version >= 0.7.1 - for SQL\r\n  backend\r\n* Werkzeug from http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/ for Slicer server\r\n* Jinja2 from http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/ for HTML presenters\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, problems or suggestions, you can send a message to the \r\nGoogle group or write to the author.\r\n\r\n* Google group: http://groups.google.com/group/cubes-discuss\r\n* IRC channel #databrewery on server irc.freenode.net\r\n\r\nReport bugs using github issue tracking: https://github.com/Stiivi/cubes/issues\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nIf you are browsing the code and you find something that:\r\n\r\n* is over-complicated or not obvious\r\n* is redundant\r\n* can be done in better Python-way\r\n\r\n... please let it be known.\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCubes is written and maintained by Stefan Urbanek (@Stiivi on Twitter)\r\n<stefan.urbanek@gmail.com> and various contributors.
