Changes in the Cubes
++++++++++++++++++++

Version 0.6
===========

News:

* added 'details' to cube - attributes that might contain fact details which are not relevant to
  aggregation, but might be interesting when displaying facts
* added ordering of facts in aggregation browser

Fixes:

* fixed localization bug in fact(s) - now uses proper attribute name without locale suffix
* fixed passing of pagination and ordering parameters from server to aggregation browser when
  requesting facts
